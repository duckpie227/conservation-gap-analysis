The species is found in the south of the state, where it is present in seven counties. The extent of occurrence of the species is 28,850&#160;km<sup>2 </sup>and area of occupancy is estimated to be around 2,000 km<sup>2</sup>. The population size is unknown and the species can be dominant in woodland. Despite this there is continuing decline in population size due to threats from habitat loss and conversion, grazing of the habitat and increased occurrence of fire. There are also concerns for the future regeneration of the species and potential habitat availability due to a local growing human population which could put pressure on the species and its habitat. The species is assessed as Near Threatened as it almost reaches the criteria for Vulnerable B2ab(iii) but is found in more than ten locations. More information on the current status of population size would be valuable.","<p>Southern California walnut is a shrub or small tree, growing to 6 - 15 m in height (Stone 1997). The species can form woodland where it may be monospecific or mixed, often occurring alongside <em>Quercus agrifolia</em>. The species is sometimes found in small stands in chaparral and coastal shrub. Trees generally occur on mesic sites such as north slopes, creekbeds, canyon bottoms, and alluvial terraces (Esser 1993). They grow best in deep, alluvial soils with high water-holding capacity. Walnut woodland generates important habitat for vertebrates and invertebrates especially birds. The species can resprout after fire.</p><p>This habitat type is currently in decline due to urbanisation and local grazing of the woodland.</p>","There are many threats to <em>Juglans californica</em>. Urbanisation, including the development of expressways and golf courses, leads to the clearance of large stands of the tree. These threats coupled with human population growth (could increase by roughly 50%) are the major future threats to the species (J. Keeley pers. comm. 2018). This could have a dramatic affect on the habitat available for the species in the future.&#160;Cattle grazing is another threat to the species reducing the regeneration potential for the species as young seedlings are consumed. These threats have led to Walnut woodland becoming fragmented and small (NatureServe 2018). There is also threat from more fire and competition with introduced invasive species. The species may also be at risk from climate change (Potter <em>et al. </em>2017). The species may become threatened by the fungal pathogen that causes Thousand Cankers Disease in <em>J. nigra </em>but currently <em>J. californica </em>shows resistance. Another risk is from hybridization with <em>J. hindsii </em>which has been introduced to <em>J. californica </em>range (Potter <em>et al. </em>2018).","<p></p><p>The species is most common in Los Angeles, Orange and Ventura counties. Small stands are found in the Simi Hills, Santa Susana Mountains, Santa Monica Mountains, San Jose Hills, Puente Hills and Chino Hills (Esser 1993). 3,500 living individuals were recorded from Sulphur Mount, Ventura County, California making up 49% of the basal area (Keeley 1990). In the same study, 1,130 living individuals were found on Mount Washington, LA County contributing to 90% of the basal area (Keeley 1990). Finally, at Montecito heights, LA County 1,710 living individuals were counted with a basal cover of 95% (Keeley 1990). At each of these three sites, there were also 50 to 100 dead individuals of the species (Keeley 1990).&#160; Keeley (1990), also looked at the size structure of the species and most individuals had a small dbh. Based on estimates from these three sites, population size is suspected to exceed 10,000 mature individuals. Nature Serve (2018) describes the population size as 'sufficient' and widespread. It can also be dominant in woodlands (Esser 1993). A lack of natural reproduction is also reported (NatureServe 2018). Subpopulations are found in protected areas and due to the species dominance in woodland, these can be large and stable subpopulations.&#160;</p><p>Riordan&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>(2015), looked at the possible behavior of this species and its' preferred habitat type in response to climate change. A potential 20,493 km<sup>2</sup>&#160;of climatically suitable habitat was identified for the species, 31% of this habitat has already been subject to decline due to anthropogenic development of urban areas and agriculture and before 2080 a further 33% could be lost. Climate change also has the potential to cause 48 - 61% of currently suitable habitat to be lost, which alongside anthropogenic changes could see&#160;<em>J. californica&#160;</em>experience habitat loss of between 64 and 70% (worst case scenario). However, climate change may not have a negative impact and could see the range of the species expand along the coast by 218% (Riordan&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2015). More information is needed on how the species will disperse, and reproduce alongside fine scale habitat and ecological information (soil moisture etc.) is needed before these models can better predict what will happen to the population size of the species in response to climate change.</p><p>Considering these details, overall the population is experiencing decline due to loss of habitat and grazing of the natural habitat. Californian Walnut forests are also becoming more fragmented. There has been great historical decline due to human population growth in the state and this growth is predicted to continue if not increase into the future. This will have a major impact on the population of <em>J. californica </em>oustide of protected areas, as available habitat may be significantly reduced. However in the protected sites large stable subpopulations will persist.</p>",Decreasing,"This species is endemic to California, USA. Following NatureServe (2018), the species is only present in the counties of Santa Barbara, Ventura, Los Angeles, San Bernardino, Orange, Riverside and San Diego.

The species is not abundant across this wide range and the population is also in rapid decline. This is caused by the invasion of the non-native, fungal pest&#160;<em>Ophiognomonia&#160;</em><em>clavigignenti-juglandacearum</em>&#160;which upon infection can kill trees. The infection can spread quickly and already the pest is found across the species range. There is limited natural resistance to this fungus which was introduced in 1967. Since this time reports of decline from different states varies from 27% to 91%. Due to this variation it is predicted that historical population decline has been up to 80%. This figure is also given to decline across a three generation shifting window and to a suspected decline, over the next 100 years. Efforts are being made to better understand ways to protect butternut from the pest. The species is currently globally assessed as Endangered.","This large tree species can grow up to 30 m in height (NatureServe 2018). The species occupies riparian sites, occurring in bottomlands and floodplains and along ravines, terraces, creeks and streams in mesophytic forest (Burns &amp; Honkala<em>&#160;</em>1990). The species can produce seed from around 20 years of age, and lives around 75 years (Michler <em>et al. </em>2006). The species is often associated with <em>Acer saccharum, Tilia americana, Lirodendron tulipifera, Quercus rubra, Fagus </em>spp. and many more hardwood types (Burns &amp; Honkala<em>&#160;</em>1990). The species is not abundant in its habitat, with individual butternut trees being found in mixed stands. It is a shade intolerant tree, and can reach the canopy (Burns &amp; Honkala<em>&#160;</em>1990, Coladonato 1991).","The greatest threat to the species is decline due to butternut canker, caused by the pathogen&#160;<em>Ophiognomonia clavigignenti-juglandacearum </em>(Borders <em>et al. </em>2015). This pest can infect trees of all age and size classes (McIlwrick <em>et al.</em>&#160;2000). It can infect rapidly and invade just as quickly, hence only a few uninfected stands remain (NatureServe 2018). The pest is thought to be waterbourne but may also be dispersed by insects (Borders <em>et al. </em>2015). Infection results in the premature death of the tree as the tree becomes girdled and the cambium is destroyed. During this time the tree can also become more susceptible to other pests and diseases which reduces the viability of the tree further (NatureServe 2018). The pest was thought to be introduced at the end of the 1960's and has since caused the global population of butternut to decline. Currently methods of mitigation are not fully understood. The population now exists in smaller numbers, than across the last century.<br/><br/>Parks <em>et al.&#160;</em>2013 also notes that the species is threatened by historical habitat loss, poor regeneration and genetic dilution caused by hybridisation with <em>Juglans ailantifolia</em>. Potter <em>et al.&#160;</em>2017 also identified that the species may be 'vulnerable' to climate change but with some capacity to adapt.","The species is 'scattered' or 'sporadic' in its habitats but may occasionally form small pure groups (Broders <em>et al. </em>2015). &#160;Small isolated pockets are found in the south of the range, and subpopulations in Wisconsin, Michingan, Ontario and Quebec are considered disjunct (Coladonato 1991). The species is rarely dominant, but in some sites is co-dominant with an overall low abundance (Michler&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2006).<br/><br/>Population is subject to a high rate of decline. This is a consequence of infection of trees by the fungus <em>Ophiognomonia clavigignenti-juglandacearum</em>, commonly known as butternut canker (Broders&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2015, NatureServe 2018). This fungal pest was first reported in 1967 and the population of butternut has continued to decline since its invasion. In some states up to 91% of trees can be infected, putting them at risk of death (McIlwrick&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2000). Seven midwestern states recorded a decline in butternut trees of 23% (Michler <em>et al. </em>2006) while Wisconsin recorded a loss of between 27 and 92% by 1992 (Michler <em>et al. </em>2006). Flickinger (2015) reports a decrease in number of butternut trees from 1.4 million individuals to 84,000 individuals, a 94% decline. In general, the average loss across reporting states is around 80% (McIlwrick <em>et al. </em>2000). The species is also subject to decline in its Canadian range at a similar rate.<br/><br/>Despite this decline the species is still present in habitat as infected individuals, uninfected saplings, mature putative resistant trees (McIlwrick <em>et al. </em>2000). The species currently maintains good genetic diversity and there is some natural resistance to&#160;<em>O. clavigignenti-juglandacearum </em>(Ross-Davis <em>et al. </em>2008). Other causes of population decline are due to habitat loss, poor regeneration and genetic dilution (Parks <em>et al. </em>2013).<br/><br/>The species produces seed from 20 to 60 years old, hence generation length is given as 40 years. Therefore, across three generations looking from 1967 to 2067 it is estimated that the population will experience decline between 50 and 80%. There has been a historical reduction of up to 80% based on the loss of trees due to butternut canker, and the variable rate this has occurred across the range. There is a high rate of infection and high rate of mortality of the tree. Decline will continue into the future as&#160;<em>O. clavigignenti-juglandacearum </em>is present across the entire species range and there is no known remedy (Parks <em>et al. </em>2013). Decline over the next 100 years could also be as much as 80%, considering a conservative estimate.",Decreasing,"This species is native to North America where it is present in much of eastern Canada and eastern United States.

The population reduction is suspected to be at least 30% over the last three generations <span style="""">(60–90&#160;year</span>s), with most of the decline in the last century, and the species is still under threat by local agriculture and hydrological modifications. Large parts of its habitat have been irreversibly destroyed or altered across its entire range. Therefore, the species is assessed as Vulnerable.","<em>Pterocarya fraxinifolia </em>is a fast-growing tree restricted to the vicinity of rivers between 0 to 800 m asl, exceptionally 1,730 m asl in the Zagros Mountains. The species generally forms a corridor along rivers and rarely extends to alluvial plains. The species grows in wet conditions and can tolerate flooding for short periods through the year.","The main threats to <em>Pterocarya fraxinifolia </em>include the destruction of its habitat, as well as logging and cutting by local people. Riparian forests in low altitude have already been severely cut in the past or converted into grassland or monospecific forests stands. In Iran, during the second half of the twentieth century, it is estimated that about 50% of the Hyrcanian forest area has disappeared. The most severe damages impact the plain and lower elevation forests, which represent the most suitable habitat for <em>P. fraxinifolia</em> and more generally riparian communities. The same analysis can be made in Georgia where 90% of the original lowland forests have been completely destroyed in the last century (Kozlowski and Gratzfeld 2013).&#160;Even in protected areas, logging and cutting by local people still represent a problem. In Iran, it is forbidden since 2017 for local people to cut trees in the forests located in Northern Iran, but the trees located in riparian environment and corridors along rivers are still impacted and sometimes destroyed because of their proximity with agricultural lands, especially for the culture of rice. The future of the species is also tributary of the possible transformation of low-altitude watercourses and river banks for hydroelectric power stations. Even if the distribution of the species seems important, the fragmentation and vulnerability of the different subpopulations is very high.&#160;Future changes toward drier climates might further endanger the species (Maharramova <em>et al.</em> 2017). Low genetic diversity may restrict the adaptation of the species to a changing environment.","The total population of <em>Pterocarya fraxinifloia</em> is difficult to estimate but certainly exceeds 10,000 individuals. The species is nowadays rare in Georgia, with the majority of subpopulations restricted to the strict perimeter of the river banks and the stands are highly fragmented and composed of a few dozen individuals. The only known important subpopulation can be found in Lapankuri, where the species is still abundant and covers a large perimeter of an alluvial plain (Kozlowski <em>et al</em>. 2018). The vegetation in riparian habitat is largely degraded by human impacts and dams (Akhani <em>et al.</em> 2010). In Iran, the species is present in riverine and valleys forests, as well as alluvial and lowland deciduous forests which have been almost entirely replaced by cultural landscapes.

However, populations from Iran which possess a larger diversity of plastid haplotypes and private alleles were sampled outside the protected areas. To counter possible losses of genetic diversity due to global warming or other human impacts, we propose that Hyrcanian populations of <em>Pterocarya fraxinifolia</em> deserve both <em>ex situ</em> and <em>in situ</em> conservation, as they contain higher amounts of genetic diversity than other populations of the genus (Maharramova <em>et al</em>. 2017).
